          <p>
            Robotic learning in simulation has become an essential tool for accelerating research and reducing costs before deployment in the real world <a href="#sim_1" class="citation">[1]</a>. 
            Training in simulation provides safety, scalability, and access to large amounts of interaction data. However, the policies that perform well in simulation often degrade of fail once transferred to real 
            robots - a challenge commonly referred to as the reality gap <a href="#gap_2" class="citation">[2]</a>. This gap arises from mismatches between the simplified models used in simulation and the complex, noisy dynamics 
            of physical systems. <br>
          
            A major line of research in sim-to-real transfer focuses on mitigating this gap. Two prominent strategies are Domain Randomization (DR) <a href="#dr_3" class="citation">[3]</a> and System 
            Identification (SI) <a href="#si_4" class="citation">[4]</a>. DR aims to expose policies to a wide variety of randomized environments during training, encouraging robustness to unseen real-world conditions. 
            SI, on the other hand, attempts to explicitly identify the dynamics of the target system, either before or during deployment, and adjust the simulation parameters accordingly. While DR offers generalization at the 
            expense of sample efficiency, SI provides more targeted adaptation but can suffer from insufficient or uninformative data for accurate identification. <br>
          
            The ASID (Active exploration for System Identification in robotic manipulation) framework <a href="#asid_5" class="citation">[5]</a> addresses this limitation by proposing methods for actively selecting exploratory 
            behaviors that maximize information about unknown system parameters. Rather than passively collecting data or relying on heuristic exploration, ASID leverages an optimization criterion based on Fisher Information to 
            generate trajectories that are maximally informative for system identification. This approach aims to make SI more efficient and reliable, ultimately improving sim-to-real transfer in robotic manipulation tasks. <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond system identification, such objectives resonate with the broader idea of curiosity-driven exploration <a href="#curios_6" class="citation">[6]</a> - encouraging robots to explore their environment without being explicitly told what to 
            do. One reason this can be extremely useful is acquiring general-purpose behaviors to accelerate the learning of new downstream tasks. Instead of training from scratch for every 
            new objective, agents can benefit 
            from a repertoire of skills - temporally extended action patterns that serve as primitives for hierarchical reinforcement learning. The paper "Diversity is All You Need" 
            (DIAYN) <a href="#diayn_7" class="citation">[7]</a> introduced the idea of unsupervised skill discovery, where an agent learns a diverse set of behaviors without requiring an external reward function. These unsupervised 
            skills not only provide a foundation for faster task learning but also enhance exploration in environments with sparse or delayed rewards, and can support applications such as imitation learning and transfer across related 
            tasks.<br>

          <p>
            However, while DIAYN and its successors demonstrated compelling results in locomotion domains such as cheetah agents, robotic manipulation remains challenging. 
            Current methods struggle to produce diverse and reusable manipulation skills without task-specific supervision, leaving open the question of how to adapt 
            unsupervised exploration principles to this more complex setting.<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Our project builds on this motivation by extending ASIDs exploration objective beyond system identification. It showed how the Fisher information can guide robots toward collecting trajectories that are informative 
            for parameter inference. We propose to adapt this principle for unsupervised skill discovery: instead of treating the objective as purely about maximizing entropy or covering all parameters equally, we reinterpret simulated 
            parameters as a curiosity signal. By selectively focusing on information along certain parameter axes while ignoring or surpressing others, the agent can discover a richer and more diverse set of skills. 
            This perspective opens the door to curiosity-guided skill discovery for robotic manipulation, bridging the gap between system identification for sim-to-real transfer and unsupervised exploration for skill learning.<br>

          <h3 class="title is-4" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Simulation-to-Reality Transfer</h3>
          <p>
            Simulators play a central role in robotics because they allow large-scale data generation without physical costs. They enable training of policies in parallel, 
            at accelerated time scales, and with full access to ground-truth state information. The real-world environment can be characterized by 
            dynamics $P(s'|s,a;\theta_*)$ with ture parameters $\theta_*$. A simulator provides approximate dynamics $\hat{P}(s'|s,a;\hat{\theta})$. Training in simulation corresponds to optimizing policies 
            under $\hat{P}$, with the hope that they transfer successfully to $P$.
          </p>

          <p>
            <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Sim-to-Real Gap</h3>
            The difference between $\hat{P}$ and $P$ is called the sim-to-real gap <a href="#gap_2" class="citation">[2]</a>. It arises from:
            <ul style="margin-top: 0.0rem; margin-left: 2.0rem; margin-bottom: 0.0rem;">
              <li><b>Modeling approximations.</b> Physical simulators cannot perfectly capture complex phenomena such as contact friction or deformable objects.</li>
              <li><b>Parameter discrepancies.</b> Even if the model form is correct, simulator parameters such as masses, delays, or sensor noise rarely match reality exactly.</li>
              <li><b>Non-stationarity of real environments.</b> Real-world conditions change over time due to wear, environmental variations, or sensor drift.</li>
            </ul>
            Bridging the sim-to-real gap is essential for deploying RL policies learned in simulation.
          </p>

          <p>
            <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Domain Randomization</h3>
            Domain Randomization (DR) trains policies on a distribution of simulators 
            with randomized parameters, thereby producing robustness to variations. 
            The intuition is that if the policy succeeds across a wide variety of simulated domains, it is likely to generalize to the real world.
            <ul style="margin-top: 0.0rem; margin-left: 2.0rem; margin-bottom: 0.0rem;">
              <li>Tobin et al. <a href="#dr_3" class="citation">[3]</a> introduced randomizing visual properties (textures, lighting, and object appearances) in a vision-based robotic 
                  grasping task. This prevented the policy from overfitting to the simulator's graphics and enabled zero-shot transfer to real images.</li>
              <li>Peng et al. <a href="#dynr_8" class="citation">[8]</a> extended this idea to dynamics parameters, perturbing e.g. masses, dumping and actuator delays.</li>
              <li>Tiboni et al. <a href="#dropo_9" class="citation">[9]</a> introduced "Domain Randomization Off-Policy Optimization" (DROPO), which formulates domain randomization itself as an optimization problem. 
                  The algorithm adapts the distribution of randomized parameters to fit real world trajectory data. Their DORAEMON framework <a href="#doraemon_10" class="citation">[10]</a> instead 
                  automatically maximizes the entropy of the parameter distribution based on a constraining success probability.</li>
            </ul>
            Domain randomization is powerful but limited by the fidelity of the simulator: if the real world lies outside the range of randomized domains, 
            transfer may still fail.
          </p>

          <p>
            <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">System Identification</h3>
            System Identification (SI) aims to directly align the simulator with reality by estimating physical parameters that make simulated trajectories match 
            real observations. Classical SI techniques require carefully designed excitation trajectories that sufficiently probe the dynamics. 

            Optimization can be performed using gradient-free methods such as CMA-ES <a href="#cmaes_11" class="citation">[11]</a>, or gradient-based methods when differentiable simulators are available. <br>
            SI methods typically rely on trajectory matching, where real and simulated trajectories are compared and parameters are adjusted to minimize discrepancies.
            
            Two main strategies can be distinguished:
            <ul style="margin-top: 0.0rem; margin-left: 2.0rem; margin-bottom: 0.0rem;">
              <li><b>Online methods:</b> alternate between simulation and real-world rollouts, continuously updating the parameter distribution. This makes them adaptive 
                but also dependent on the quality of the current policy. An recent representative method is <a href="#simopt_12" class="citation">[12]</a>, which updates parameter distributions after comparing simulated 
            and real rollouts of the same policy.</li>
              <li><b>Offline methods:</b> use real trajectory datasets that are replayed and the missmatch between real and sim observations is optimized. They depend on accurate observations form the real system. 
                A recent work includes DROPO <a href="#dropo_9" class="citation">[9]</a>. 
                Furthermore, one could make a further distinction whether to reset the simulator state in between. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Active Exploration for System Identification</h3>
            The ASID framework <a href="#asid_5" class="citation">[5]</a> reframes SI as an active exploration problem. Instead of relying on hand-designed excitation signals, ASID trains exploration policies that maximize the 
            Fisher information about unknown dynamics parameters. The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ under trajectory distribution $p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ is defined as
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              $$\mathcal{I}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{\tau} \sim p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}} [\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{\tau})\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\boldsymbol{\tau})^T]$$
            </p>
            
            Maximizing the trace of $\mathcal{I}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ ensures that the resulting data are maximally informative for parameter estimation.
            ASID exhibits that exploratory policies trained in simulation often transfer well to reality, even when task policies do not. 
            By decoupling exploration from exploitation, ASID enables robots to collect informative trajectory in the real world that can then be used to refine the 
            simulator and learn downstream task policies. This represents a mixture of classical SI with modern RL-based exploration. </p>
            
            The ASID pipeline consists of three tightly connected stages:
            <ol style="margin-top: 1.0rem; margin-left: 2.0rem; margin-bottom: 0.0rem;">
            <li><b>Exploration:</b> An exploration policy is trained in simulation with the goal of maximizing the Fisher information of the resulting 
              trajectories w.r.t. physical properties. This ensures that actions taken in the real system will be maximally informative for system idenfification. 
              Importantly, training is done purely in simulation, exploiting inexpensive rollouts.</li>
            <li><b>System Identification:</b> The learned exploration policy is executed on the real robot to collect informative trajectories. They are then used 
              in a system identification step, to estimate key simulation parameters such as inertial properties or friction coefficients.
              By reducing model mismatch, the updated simulator provides a more accurate model for downstream learning.</li>
            <li><b>Policy Optimization and Transfer:</b> With the refined simulator, a task-specific policy is trained using standard RL. 
              Finally the trained policy can be deployed zero-shot in the real world. i.e., without requireing further adaptation. </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning</h3>
            Unsupervised reinforcement learning aims to pretrain agents without external task rewards by relying on intrinsic objectives that encourage broad 
            exploration and the discovery of diverse behaviors. Instead of optimizing a single extrinsic return, the agent seeks to acquire skills or representations 
            that can later accelerate downstream task learning, reduce sample complexity, or support zero-shot transfer. This paradigm is particularly appealing in robotics, 
            where task-specific rewards are expensive to design and real-world interactions are costly or unsafe. The central challenge is defining intrinsic signals 
            that produce both diverse and useful behaviors, rather than uncontrolled exploration.
          </p>

          <p>
            <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Related Works</h3>
            In prior approaches, skill discovery is treated as maximizing the mutual information between latent skill variables and the resulting state distributions:
            "Variational Intrinsic Control" <a href="#vic_14" class="citation">[14]</a> and 
            "Diversity Is All You Need" <a href="#diayn_7" class="citation">[7]</a> showed that a latent-conditioned policy can be trained to produce distinct, repeatable behaviors
            through those information-theoretic objectives. Extensions like "Dynamics-Aware Discovery of Skills" <a href="#dads_15" class="citation">[15]</a> incorporate dynamics models to motivate
            learning predictable interactions. Other approaches count state visitations 
            <a href="#count_16" class="citation">[16]</a> or maximize state coverage <a href="#cover_17" class="citation">[17]</a>, but broad coverage alone does not guarantee that learned skills are semantically meaningful or composable.
            An approach focussing on discovering essential and transfereable skills for robotic mainpulation (multi-)tasks is proposed in <a href="#robman_18" class="citation">[18]</a>.<br>
            
            These works demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring reusable skills in simulation, and applications were realized in locomotion 
            and robotic manipulation. However, key challenges are: unsupervised objectives often require large numbers of interactions, and ensuring sample efficiency and safety is often difficult. 
            Also, skills discovered through maximizing diversity may not align with downstream tasks, and their transfer from sim to real is complicated by modeling errors. 
            Those issues motivate frameworks like ASID. In this project we combine both concepts.

          <p>
            The objective of the exploration module in ASID is to collect trajectories that are maximally informative about the system's unknown physical parameters. 
            This is formalized through the notion of Fisher information, which measures how sensitive the system's next states are to variations in these parameters.
            Policies trained under this objective persue states where the dynamics are most affected by parameter changes, thereby producing observations that support accurate system identification later on.
          
            In practice, the authors identify three key challenges in making this objective workable:
            <ol style="margin-top: 0.0rem; margin-left: 2.0rem; margin-bottom: 0.0rem;">
              <li><b>Complexity of the information measure.</b> In general, computing Fisher information exactly is intractable. To make the problem solvable, the authors assume a simplified structure of the 
                systb dynamics that highlights states where parameter sensitivity is highest. This is realized by applying Gaussian process noise for observations.</li>
              <li><b>Unknown true parameters.</b> Since the actual systb parameters are not known during training, the optimization cannot be performed directly. Instead, the method relies on domain randomization, 
                training policies against a distribution of possible parameters rather than a single fixed value. This approximation is sufficient to yield effective exploration behaviors in practice.</li>
              <li><b>Non-differentiable simulators.</b> Many physics engines, including Mujoco, do not expose analytical derivatives with respect to system parameters. To address this, the authors approximate 
                parameter sensitivities using finite differences: perturbing parameters slightly in both directions and measuring the effect on the next state.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          For the exploration stage, we directly rely on the publicly available ASID <a href="https://github.com/WEIRDLabUW/asid">exploration module</a> provided by the original authors.
          The exploration module is implemented in Python and makes use of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm together with vectorized Mujoco environments, which enables efficient parallel trainign.

          <h3 class="title is-4" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">System Identification</h3>
          <p>
            In the system identification phase, our goal is to adapt specific parameters in the simulator, so that it reproduces the real-world dynamics observed during the exploration phase.
            First, a trajectory $\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{real}} \sim p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^*( \cdot | \pi_{\text{exp}})$ is collected by executing the learned exploration policy $\pi_{\text{exp}}$ in the real environment. 
            The simulator is then updated such that simulated rollouts align with this reference trajectory. 
            Concretely, the objective is to find a distribution over simulation parameters $\boldsymbol{q}_{\phi}$ that minimizes the expected trajectory mismatch between observations
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              $$ \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{\theta} \sim q_\phi} [ \mathbb{E}_{\tau_{\text{sim}} \sim p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}( \cdot | \mathcal{A}(\tau_{\text{real}}) )}  [|| \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{real}} - \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{sim}} ||_2^2] ]$$
            </p>
            where $p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\cdot | \mathcal{A}(\tau_{\text{real}}))$ is the trajectory distribution in the simulator when replaying the exact action sequence from the real trajectory $\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{real}}$ (offline).
            This ensures that discrepancies in dynamics are attributed to parameter misspecification, rather than policy mismatch.<br>

            In our re-implementation, we additionally explore a variation of the procedure where trajectory samples are generated by executing the current policy directly (online) 
            instead of replaying the real-world action sequence. This experimental comparison enables us to investigate the trade-off between strict action-replay matching and on-policy identification.<br>
            
            For the trajectory optimization, the ASID framework allows the use of any black-box optimizer. The authors use Cross Entropy Method <a href="#cem_19" class="citation">[19]</a> for the real experiments, and Relative Entropy Policy Search <a href="#reps_20" class="citation">[20]</a> for simulation. 
            In this project, we implement both methods and compare them. <br>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Cross Entropy Method</h3>
            The Cross Entropy Method (CEM) is a population-based black-box optimization algorithm. It maintains a Gaussian distribution $q(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ over parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ and iteratively refines this distribution by 
            focusing on "elite" samples - those with the lowest objective values (or equivalently, highest rewards). Over time, $q$ concentrates around promising regions of the parameter space.

            Hyperparameters include:
            <ul style="margin-top: 0.0rem; margin-left: 2.0rem; margin-bottom: 0.0rem;">
              <li><b>$S$</b> - the number of candidate parameter vectors sampled per iteration.</li>
              <li><b>$e$</b> - fraction of samples selected as elites.</li>
              <li><b>$\alpha$</b> - smoothing factor controls how strongly the new mean/std deviate from the previous iteration.</li>

            <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Relative Entropy Policy Search</h3>
            Relative Entropy Policy Search (REPS) is an information-theoretic optimization method originally developed for reinforcement learning, but it can be applied generally 
            to black-box optimization problems such as system identification. The central idea is to update a sampling distribution over candidate parameters in such a way that the expected reward is maximized, 
            while constraining the update by a KL-divergence bound. This ensures that updates are stable and avoid premature collapse of the distribution.
            Formally, given a set of sampled rewards $r_i$ REPS solves the constrained optimization problem
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: center;">
          $$\max_q \sum_{i} q_i r_i \quad\mathrm{}\quad \text{s.t.} \quad\mathrm{}\quad D_{KL}(q || u) \leq \epsilon, \quad\mathrm{}\quad \sum_{i} q_i = 1$$
          </p>

          where $u$ is the uniform distribution over samples and $\epsilon > 0$ controls the size of the update. The dual problem introduces a Lagrange multiplier $\eta$, leading to the optimal distribution
          <p style="text-align: center;">
          $$q^*_i \propto \text{exp}(\frac{r_i}{\eta})$$
          </p>

          Thus, the sample weights $w_i$ are given by a normalized exponential tilt of the rewards, where $\eta$ is obtained by minimizing the convex dual
          <p style="text-align: center;">
          $$ g(\eta) = \eta \epsilon + \eta \log(\frac{1}{S} \sum_{i=1}^S \text {exp}(\frac{r_i}{\eta}))$$

        <h3 class="title is-4" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Rod Balancing Task</h3>
          <p>
            Balancing and stacking objects are canonical tasks in robotic manipulation that critically depend on accurate inertial parameters.
            To evaluate ASID's ability to perform active system identification, the original authors designed a <em>Rod Balancing</em> task. In this setting, the agent interacts with a rod whose internal mass distribution 
            is varied across episodes. The agent must infer the inertial parameters of the rod by probing it through exploratory actions. Once identified, this knowledge is required to solve the downstream task: 
            balancing the rod by placing it on a tower of cubes. It is essential to identify the rods exact center of mass (refered to as inertia) to stabalize it on top. 
            As the focus of our re-implementation lies in reproducing the exploration behavior and verifying its potential for accurate system identification, we do not consider learning the actual balancing task. However, we 
            use the provided simulation environment by the authors.
          </p>

          <p>
            <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Experimental Setup</h3>
            The simulated Franka Emika Panda robot arm is mounted on a fixed table. According to the applied domain randomization, the placement of the rod is perturbed uniformly within fixed ranges:
            $x = 0.4 \pm 0.1$ meters and $y = 0.3 + 0.1$.
            The rod itself is modeled as a box of dimensions 0.04 x 0.3 x 0.04 meters. For exploring, the parameter of interest is the mass distribution 
            (inertia) along the length of the rod, which is uniformly varied within [-0.1, 0.1] for each episode. Therefore,
            we train the exploration policy only w.r.t. to the distribution of mass, but use the resulting policy to infer the inertia and friction parameters of the rod. <br>

            The robot is controlled at the end-effector level. Following the original design, the arm is constrained to operate in the x-y plane, resulting in two degrees of freedom (2-DoF) for the exploration task.

          <p>
            The exploration policy was trained using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), with a total of 250,000 timesteps. We used 12 parallel training environments and 4 parallel evaluation environments (~3.5 hours - CPU only). 
            Here, we present a brief training analysis with visualizations of the exploration behavior of the resulting policy.

          </div>

          <p>
            Generally, we can see that the trajectories aim at interaction. Although the center of mass marked by the blue sphere is unknown to the agent, 
            we can observe that the gripper seems to target it to prevent losig contact with the rod.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, we analyze the network losses: The decreasing actor loss (policy network) suggests that the policy is improving its action selection and becoming 
            more optimal over time. However, the increasing critic loss (value network) is having difficulty approximating the value function accurately. 
            We have noticed this in other settings as well, but at the same time, we find that the policy still reflects a plausible exploration capability.

          <p>
            In this section, we present the results optained from the system idenfication, specifically inertia and friction, based on the previously learned 
            exploration policy. 
            
            To emulate the real-world trajectory we seperately configure a simulator. The real and initial simulation parmeters compared with their parameter ranges 
            used for DR during exploration and here, for initialization of the optimizers (std/cov) are the following:
            <ul style="margin-top: 0.0rem; margin-left: 2.0rem; margin-bottom: 0.0rem;">
              <li><b>Real</b> [inertia, friction]: [-0.1, 1.0] - rods center of mass is on the left side and the rod has low friction.</li>
              <li><b>Initial</b> [inertia, friction]: [0.1, 3.0] - rods center of mass is on the right side and the rod has high friction.</li>
              <li><b>Ranges:</b> inertia [-0.1, 0.1], friction [1.0, 3.0]</li>
            </ul>
          
            This initialization creates a significant discrepancy, requiring the optimizer to recover the correct dynamics.
          </p>

          <p>
            We apply CEM and REPS. For each method, we evaluate the two modes:
            <ul style="margin-top: 0.0rem; margin-left: 2.0rem; margin-bottom: 0.0rem;">
              <li><b>Offline</b> mode follows the ASID framework, the optimizer replays the action sequence of the real trajectory when generating simulated rollouts.</li>
              <li><b>Online</b> mode introduced here as an experimental variation, the optimizer instead generates rollouts by executing actions from the current policy.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          
          The used hyperparameters for the optimizers are listed in the following tables:

          We present the objective values representing the observation missmatch (L2) between the targeted "real" trajectory and optimized trajectoriy:

            </p>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            Based on this experiment, we find that our REPS variants are both able to reduce the trajectory missmatch nearly perfectly. Although the offline version 
            required less iterations to convergence, we can confirm both are suited for system identificiation. However, the CEM methods do not perform at all. We tested different 
            conservation rations for the alpha update of the standard deviation to prevent premature narrowing, but could not find a suited configuration. Therefore, 
            we don't want to exclude the possibility that this is an implementation error.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, we can analyze the parameter evoluations:
          </p>

          <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
            <img src="static/images/sysid/parameter_history.png" alt="Exploration policy" style="max-width: 85%; height: auto; border-radius: 12px; box-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1);"/>

            </p>
          </div>
          
          <p>
            Again, we oberve the obvious performance difference between REPS and CEM variants. Interestingly, CEM's parameter evolutions for friction suggest slight improvement. 
            Generally, the inertia parameter seems to be inferable more accurately by the REPS variants compared to friction. This is likely due to the exploration policy beeing 
            explicitely targeted to maximize inertial sensitivity. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, we show visual results of trajectories optimized using offline variants of CEM and REPS. We show trajectories after 0 (initial), 10 (intermediate), and 25 (final) optimization iterations 
            compared to the targeted "real" trajectory:

          <h3 class="title is-4" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Idea of Weighted Fisher Information</h3>
          <p>
            We introduce our idea of weighted Fisher information intuitively by deriving it from the exploration objective of ASID framework.
            ASID's reward for the exploration policy is defined as the trace of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), 
            i.e., the sum of its diagonal components. This encourages the policy to collect trajectories that are informative with respect to all 
            system parameters simultaneously. While this formulation is principled, it implicitly treats all parameters as equally relevant, 
            which may not always be desirable in practice. While it leads to informative trajectories for system idenfification, for skill discovery 
            focuses on exploring a variaty of "information directions".
          </p>
          <p>
            We adapt the objective by introducing parameter-specific weights for each parameters information component. 
            Instead of maximizing the total information, the agent can now be guided to prioritize certain directions in parameter space over others. 
            This design allows us to interpret the weights as a form of curiosity modulation: high weights encourage exploration behavior towards a parameter, 
            while low weights discourage it.
            Taking the rod balancing task as an example, if the exploration policy is rewarded for maximizing information about mass while 
            ignoring (or penalizing) information about friction, we hypothesize that the robot might attempt to learn some kind of grasping skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a broader sense, this mechanism allows sampling different weight configurations and obtain families of exploratory skills, 
            each corresponding to a distinct focus on specific system parameters. Ultimately, the goal would be to condition task policies on 
            such latent skills to leverage parameter-focused exploration. Furthermore, the sample distribution of weights could be iteratively adapted
            to encourage learning usefull skills for downstream tasks. 
          </p>
          

          
          <h3 class="title is-4" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Implementing Weighted Fisher Information</h3>

          To realize the concept of weighted Fisher Information, we introduce a vector of parameter weights $w \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{param}}}$, 
          which allows scaling of the diagonal entries of the Fisher Information Matrix $\mathcal{I}$. 
          The modified reward becomes:
          <p style="text-align: center;">
            $$ r = \sum_{j = 1}^{d_{\text{param}}} w_j \mathcal{I}_{jj}$$
          </p>
          This formulation generalizes ASIDs objective, which corresponds to the special case $w_j = 1$.
          Unlike the original ASID reward, our formulation may yield negative values when some weights are set negative, effectively penalizing information gain in 
          certain directions. Therefore, to maintain stability, we additionally clip the reward values to the interval [-1000, 1000].


          <h3 class="title is-4" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Challenges and Solutions</h3>
          <p>
            The introduction of weighted Fisher information rewards required extensive experimentation to address several non-trivial challenges. 
            To keep the complexity manageable, we restricted our analysis to pairs of parameters (e.g. inertia vs. friction), which already revealed key difficulties 
            in balancing sensitivities, shaping rewards, and selecting weights.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Different Parameter Sensitivities</h3>
          <p>
            The first challenge was the imbalance in the magnitudes of information components. In the original ASID formulation, summing the diagonal entries of the FIM (i.e., 
            the trace) is straightforward, since all contributions are positive. With weighted rewards, however, negative weights can lead to 
            unintended dominance of one parameter. For example, even a small negative weight (e.g. -0.1) on friction could overpower inertia contributions 
            if the Fisher information for friction was several orders of magnitude larger, resulting in consistently negative rewards.
          </p>

          <p>
            A related problem arose in the computation of finite-difference gradients for the FIM, where different parameters required different step sizes $\Delta t$.
            We experimented with several solutions:
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Normalizing the FIM</b>: In an initial attempt, we applied a simple normalization strategy to the the diagonal information components:
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              $$ \text{diag}(F) \leftarrow \frac{\text{diag}(F)}{\max{\text{diag}(F)}} \cdot 500$$
            </p>
            However, results did not turn out convincing (flat or slightly negative return curves), 
            probably due to this modification preserving relative magnitudes but destroying the absolute information scale. </li>
          </p>

          <p> 
            <b>Parameter-specific normalization factors and delta values:</b>
            By assigning tailored scaling to each parameter, the reward contributions 
            can be balanced without distorting the underlying information structure. 
            This proved most effective, though it requires careful tuning to 
            identify good normalization constants.
          </p>



          </p>
          <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Sparse Reward Environment</h3>
          <p>
            The environment only yields meaningful Fisher information when the robot interacts with the rod. Without such contact, 
            rewards vanish, leading to sparse signals and slow policy improvement. To alleviate this, we introduced reward shaping by 
            adding a penalty proportional to the Euclidean distance between the end-effector and the rod:
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              $$ r \leftarrow  r - || x_\text{ee} - x_\text{rod}||^2_2 \cdot 10$$

          <p>
            This encouraged the robot to approach the rod, thus increasing the chance of interaction. <br>
            A subtle trade-off emerged: too strong penalty biased the policy towards simply reaching the rod without performing informative interactions. 
            To mitigate this, we initially deactivated the distance penalty once the rod was reached. However, experiments showed that keeping a small shaping 
            term active was beneficial, as it encouraged the robot to sustain contact with the rod thereby maintaining exploration pressure.

          <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Selecting Effective Weights</h3>
          <p>
            
            Ininally, choosing suitable weight combinations was itself a challenge. Some parameters exhibited coupled responses, making it difficult 
            to separate their effects, especially during early interactions. For example, assigning weights [+1, -1] often led to near-zero rewards, 
            as coupled dynamics canceled out. Conversely, small asymmetries such as [+1, \pm 0.1] did not sufficiently enforce distinct parameter-specific 
            exploration.

          </p>
          <p>
            Through initial empirical evaluation, we found that moderate asymmetries such as [1.0, -0.5] worked reasonably. 
            They introduced a clear bias towards one parameter while still penalizing the other, without completely collapsing the reward signal.
          </p>




          <h3 class="title is-4" style="margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Discovering Skills</h3>
          
          In this section we present the setup and results for unsupervised skill discovery applying the concept of weighted Fisher information.
          
          <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Experimental Setup</h3>
          
          <p>
          The goal is to study the effect of the modified - Fisher information weighted - reward function by observing the learned interaction behavior of the robot. 
          Specifically, we would like to find out whether it is possible to learn different manipulation skills and analyze how they correspond to the weighted parameters. 
          We use three parameters and systematically test each pair with both weighting combinations ([1.0, -0.5] and [-0.5, 1.0]) totaling in six skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          The experiment is carried out in the same rod balancing environment as introduced earlier in the re-implementation sections. Importantly, we do not apply domain randomization. 
          For unlimited exploration capability, we also drop the xy-plane restriction of the endeffector and allow free control of pose and gripper width (7-DoF).
          Note, this significantly increases the action space and requires longer training times. Despite applying reward shaping, we account for that by using a pretrained policy for initialization. 
          We trained one for 200,000 timesteps w.r.t. inertia and friction and selected a policy state with minimal interaction to keep the introduced bias reasonable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of the six policies induced by a combination of weights and parameters is trained for 250,000 total steps (~5 hours - CPU only) and the episode length is limited to 30 steps.
          Following parameters are considered: <b>inertia</b> (position of the rods center of mass), <b>friction</b> and <b>mass</b> (properties of the rod).
        </p> 

          <p>To ensure that each parameters information contribution to the reward can be weighted consistently, it is essential to tune the normalization factors 
          and finite differences delta time steps. A simple interaction resulting from the pretrained policy is used as a benchmark for tuning: 
          We adjust normalization factors and gradient deltas for each parameter manualy based on the cumulative parameter information for each parameter (diagonals of FIM) 
          obtained through interaction over four episodes. The following animation visualizes reference interaction, return, distance penalty, and importantly the information responses 
          for each parameter after tuning.</p>

          <h3 class="title is-5" style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Results</h3>
          
          <p>To analyze the skill lerning process, we compute return and <em>information return</em> during evaluations performed after each 5.000 training steps.
          The returns shown in the following static plots are computed, by cummulating rewards (clipped) and averaging over four parallel evaluation episodes.
          Analogous, the information-return of a parameter consists of the parameters Fisher information commulated and averaged over evaluation episodes (no clipping). 
          The resulting plots enable comparing the returns and the parameters individual contribution to the return (without weighting) during the learning process.</p>

          <p>A skill based on rewards e.g. computed based on 1.0 weighted inertia and -0.5 weighted friction information is denoted as <b><em>inertia-friction</em></b> skill; 
          for reversed weights, we write <b><em>friction-inertia</em></b> skill.
          For each skill, we present the animated trajectory of the behavior extracted from the evaluation step with the highest return (marked by the blue arrow).</p>
          
          <p>
            <b>Inertia vs. Friction </b>
          </p>
          Return based learning curves for both skills are relatively low [-1000; 3000] compared to other skills. High inertia spikes in the left plot suggest that there are multiple interaction behaviors achieving similar 
          returns in the mid-phase of training. For the total training duraion, the friction-inertia skill learning resulted in only one notable friction-explorative skill instance. Both learning processes are unstable.

          <p>Both skills exhibit behavior that would be expected: The inertia-friction skill focuses on repeatingly rotating of the rod (maximizing inertia information because this only works if the force is 
          applied near the center of mass) and chosing the rods long axis to minimize friction information. The friction-inertia skill seemingly tries to minimize any movement of the rod while brushing over 
          its surface to maximizes friction information.</p>

          <p>
            <b>Friction vs. Mass </b>
          </p>
          The left plot indicates a very strong friction-mass skill, whose learning process started late (half of training time), but generated a return (10,000) that is significantly higher than for the contrasting skill (2.000).
          The learning curve of the mass-friction skill shows that the pretrained behavior which aquired already the same mass information as reached - only once again - by the end of the training.

          <p>Observing the friction-mass skill, we can see friction and mass informative movements. By analyzing the episodic information-return responses, we can confirm that both parameters exhibit similar curves 
          and lead to positive rewards only due to the weighting. We can conclude that the agent does not really learn to differentiate between mass and friction explorative behavior in this case.
          For the mass-friction skill, same applies in a weaker way. We suspect that this is related to strong parameter coupling. Furthermore, based on the limited training of 250.000 timesteps, we can not verify
          our hypothesis that friction-mass skill results in grasping behavior.

          Training the mass-inertia policy resulted in oscilating return curves, however, with multiple skill "states" reaching 4.000. For the given training time, the return curve of the inertia-mass skill
          shows a sharp decline (-5.000). It recoveres reaching a maximum return of 1.000 (excluding the pretrained state) but remains near zero, indicating a weak skill.

          The mass-inertia skill seems to secure the position of the rod after bumping it - maybe preventing it from further movement.
          When performing the inertia-mass skill, the robot does not directly aim at the center of mass, as it was the case when exploring toward mass. 
          Contrary to expectations, nearly no mass information response results from the short but impulsive rod push. 
          (We can imagine that the agent learned to exploit the masses bigger gradient delta time (0.2 >> 0.005) - effectively bypassing the response through fast interaction.)

        <div class="content has-text-justified">

          Our experiments with weighted Fisher Information rewards revealed several open challenges and design trade-offs. 
          <ul style="margin-top: 0.0rem; margin-left: 2.0rem; margin-bottom: 0.0rem;">
              <li><b>Weights.</b> The choice of negative weights must be handled carefully. While moderate values such as -0.5 combined with 1.0 worked well in balancing parameter exploration, 
                larger negative weights often amplified parameter coupling and collapsed the reward signal. 
                Smaller magnitudes for penalizing information appear more stable, however might not result in parameter-distinguishable behavior and should be studied in future work.</li>
                <li><b>Non-linear Weighting.</b> A promising direction for stabilizing learning lies in experimenting with non-linear weighting functions. Instead of simple linear combinations of FIM components, 
                  operations such as square roots could smooth out extreme values and improve training robustness. Finally, our current formulation only exploits the diagonal of 
                  the Fisher matrix. The off-diagonal entries encode parameter coupling and could be leveraged to explicitly reward disentanglement of parameter sensitivities, potentially 
                  leading to richer skill sets. </li>
                <li><b>Reward Shaping.</b> A second key trade-off lies in reward shaping. While the introduced distance penalty successfully reduced sparsity and encouraged continuous rod interaction, 
                  it comes at the risk of biasing exploration towards mere proximity rather than meaningful skill discovery. Striking the right balance between shaping and unbiased 
                  learning remains an open question.</li>
              <li><b>Tuning.</b> Another limitation is the manual tuning requirement. Both normalization factors and finite-difference delta parameters must be adjusted manualy for each environment and parameter. 
                  This introduces overhead and prevents straightforward generalization. Automating this tuning process, e.g., via adaptive normalization 
                  would make the method more practical.</li>
                <li><b>Hardware Limitation.</b> On the systems side, hardware limitations restricted the amount of training we could perform. To compensate, we used pretrained policies, but this inevitably 
                      introduced bias into exploration. Future work should focus on enabling longer training schedules and longer episode lengths to hopefully learn more complex behavior.

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          In this work, we re-implemented the two central stages of the ASID (Active Exploration for System Identification in Robotic Manipulation) framework: Explotation and System Identification.<br>
          
          Our results confirm the viability of ASID's design: exploration guided by Fisher information enables informative interactions, enabling the identificaion of unknown parameters - 
          even if the exploration policy was trained w.r.t. only one parameter.
          
          Our weighted-FIM extension demonstrates the feasibility of steering exploration towards parameter-specific skills, but also highlights the difficulty of balancing information scaling, 
          sparsity, and coupling effects. 

          Overall, the re-implementation and adaptation of the objective not only validated the original paper's findings but also opened new directions for extending the framework 
          towards curiosity-driven, skill-conditioned exploration in robotic manipulation.<br>
